I'm proud to announce the second release candidate of HTML_Progress 1.2.0
The RC stage means that HTML_Progress is now feature complete, and is quite stable. 
Stable enough for everyone to start playing with.
Note that it is still not recommended for mission-critical use.

This release included:
- new shapes: circle, ellipse, square, rectangle
- HTML_Progress_Monitor::setAnimSpeed was marked as deprecated, and will be remove 
  on future version. Use instead the parent HTML_Progress bar.
- HTML_Progress_Uploader used now the Net_FTP package dependencies 
  for ftp communications.
- PEAR_ErrorStack replaced Error_Raise packages by Greg Beaver to manage 
  all internal HTML_Progress errors.

----------
IMPORTANT:

HTML_Progress 1.2.0RC2 requires PHP version 4.1.0 and PEAR 1.3.1 or greater.

Take care that to use the new HTML_Progress_Uploader, you'll need PHP 4.3 or greater
and ftp extension loaded.

There are also some mandatory dependencies with others PEAR packages :
- HTML_Common 1.2 or greater                   http://pear.php.net/HTML_Common
- Log 1.8.0 or greater                         http://pear.php.net/Log

- HTML_CSS 0.3.1 or greater                    http://pear.php.net/HTML_CSS
- HTML_Page 2.0.0RC2 or greater                http://pear.php.net/HTML_Page
- Config 1.9 or greater                        http://pear.php.net/Config

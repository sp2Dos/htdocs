I'm proud to announce the third release candidate of HTML_Progress 1.2.0
The RC stage means that HTML_Progress is now feature complete, and is quite stable. 
Stable enough for everyone to start playing with.

This release included:
- HTML_Progress_Uploader is now removed
- new API error management methods: hasErrors(), getError() in core class HTML_Progress
- new method hide() to make progress bar invisible and not removed
- new methods sleep(), run(), process(), setProgressHandler()
- add new optional parameter $msg on method raiseError()
